### The Challenge

At the moment, CG staff would like to have more visibility of the contacts made in an event by themselves and the rest of the staff.

In particular, being able to share information quickly across the whole network would be a way of unblocking the process between connecting artists and those wanting to work with or support them

### Our Solution?

### The aims of the solution

Create a Web App where the CG staff can easily record the list of the interactions made in an event and be able to quickly share this with the rest of his/her colleagues.

#### Process

User Stories

We began by aligning on the main user stories that were key to the success of the prototype. There were:

 * As a member of the team I want to be able to record the info quickly and easily so that we will actually use it.
 
* As I a user I want to be able to be prompted to record contact details so that we have them and use them

* As a user I want to be able to record recommendations I made so that I can follow up how or if that had an impact

* As a user I want to be able to record some details of the connection in a free form so that someone can refer to this if it's not me following up.

#### Prototype

We then built prototypes in Figma to help map the user journey more thoroughly.

### Further Development

#### User Testing

User testing allows you to get feedback from your primary users to check that the product being built fits their needs. This is very important to build a successful product.

The three key points for testing are:

 - Have a script which has tasks for them to complete
- Ask for people to give you a commentry of what they are doing, but don't respond to them.
 - Document their response

Here are some useful resources to look at when completing your user testing sessions:

- [Googles Gurilla Testing Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YL0xoSmyZI&feature=youtu.be)
- [Script Guidance and Template](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/user-testing.md#1-planning)

_If you had to leave only one feature, which one would it be?_

Recommendations for user testing:

Currently the app is all local to the users device - any interactions they record are only visible to them. For this app, user testing should focus on the flow and how the team see themselves using the app (if at all!).

#### Next Sprint

If this design is move forward for a build sprint it is important to concentrate on key features that both solves the initital problem and implements feedback from user testing.

Some initial features for the next design sprint could be:

- Incorporating feedback from user testing
- Refactoring and adding scaleability to the codebase
- Connecting the app to a linked database so all team members can see each other's interactions
